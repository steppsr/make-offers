# Make Offers

This Windows Powershell script will create offer files using a list of Launcher Coin IDs. You can use the nfts-in-collection script to create a list of Launcher Coin IDs if needed.

### User Config

* For now, the script supports Chia or ABA. You can add additional forks by adding to the `$blockchains = @("chia","aba")` line.

### Output

The script will create offer files and save the offer codes into files into a folder.

### Running the script

```PowerShell
.\make_offers.ps1
```
